        <p>I love solving problems. Tough, complex, and challenging problems fascinate me to no end. I've always been fascinated with the interplay of humans and technology.</p>

        <p>My interests: Data Engineering, Scalable WebApps, Customer Behavioral Science</p>

        <p>For data enthusiasts I recommend <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying" target="_blank">this article</a> heavily, its a must read, I keep revisiting this article for perspective on data engineering. It's simply awesome, talks so much about basics of DE.</p>

        <p>In the past, I’ve worked on a variety of different projects, including remarketing engine, data management platform, recommendation engines, data pipeline for calculating ROI for display ads, event driven systems etc. You can read more about them below.</p>

        <p>Building B2B software is a different ballgame altogether. The complexities involved, the constrains, the stakeholders, the features, the functionalities, the technicalities, dozens of personas, and hundreds of use-cases – its mind boggling. But at the end, it's very rewarding when you think about users who pay to use your product for 8 hours a day, as a part of their job. I’m glad that I’ve gotten the opportunity to do so at SegmentOne.</p>

        <p class="post-link">I remember pulling all nighters, working for tens of hours at a stretch, working on some of the most ridiculous ideas. But the biggest pleasure was to build an event-driven system which required a simple approach to build a complex and scalable system. I also managed a team of 6 engineers, 1 data scientist, 1 designer, 3 sales people and 2 content writers.</p>
