          <em style="font-style: italic">Data</em> • Technology</h4>

        <p>I love solving problems. Tough, complex, and challenging problems fascinate me to no end. I've always been fascinated with the interplay of humans and technology.</p>

        <p>My interests: Data Engineering, Scalable WebApps, Customer Behavioral Science</p>

        <p>For data enthusiasts I recommend <a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying" target="_blank">this article</a> heavily, its a must read, I keep revisiting this article for perspective on data engineering. It's simply awesome, talks so much about basics of DE.</p>

        <p>In the past, I’ve worked on a variety of different projects, including remarketing engine, data management platform, recommendation engines, data pipeline for calculating ROI for display ads, event driven systems etc. You can read more about them below.</p>

        <h4>Mumbai</h4>
        <p class="first">Co-founded SegmentOne. Segmentone is an AI based customer engagement platform helping online businesses target each customer uniquely, allowing them to send RIGHT marketing message to the RIGHT customer at the RIGHT time via RIGHT channel.</p>
        <p>Building B2B software is a different ballgame altogether. The complexities involved, the constrains, the stakeholders, the features, the functionalities, the technicalities, dozens of personas, and hundreds of use-cases – its mind boggling. But at the end, it's very rewarding when you think about users who pay to use your product for 8 hours a day, as a part of their job. I’m glad that I’ve gotten the opportunity to do so at SegmentOne.</p>

But the biggest pleasure was to build an event-driven system which required a simple approach to build a complex and scalable system. I also managed a team of 6 engineers, 1 data scientist, 1 designer, 3 sales people and 2 content writers.</p>

        <p class="first">At Insight, I was among the top performers and succesfully built a data product called ADability to analyze ads performance and viewability. I architected and implemented a scalable data pipeline for analyzing TB’s of ad interaction data. My existing industry experience and startup work ethic allowed me to excel during the fellowship and build a robust project. I was offered a job from CapitalOne in New York.</p>

        <p class="first">An awful lot of what I’ve learnt and what I’m right now has been because of the internships I’d done over the years.

        <p>I also worked at Cobalt.io, which is an application security platform for enterprises for a few months, designing and developing their client side dashboard, and working on a lot of product improvements, and random impromptu Design tasks (you
          know how it works at startups!)</p>

          In the summer of 2015, I interned at Wikimedia Foundation (it is the non-profit which owns and operates Wikipedia and other Wikis) at their San Francisco headquarters. </p>
