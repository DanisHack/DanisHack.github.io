        <p>I love solving problems. Tough, complex, and challenging problems fascinate me to no end. I've always been fascinated with the interplay of humans and technology.</p>

        <p>At the moment, I’m working at Playment, which is an early-stage startup in Bangalore focussed on crowdsourcing training data for computer vision based startups and companies working in autonomous driving, visual search, satellite imagery.</p>

        <p>In the past, I’ve worked on a variety of different projects, including an internship at Wikimedia, some Data Visualization projects, product design internships at startups, and some random projects while at university. You can read more about them below.</p>

        <p class="first">Data Visualization has been something I’ve taken active interest in since the past few years. Charts and Graph was my favourite section in Microsoft Excel as a child. The tools and techniques have changed a lot, but the interest has been steadfast.
          The idea of taking a big huge datasets, and then weaving stories around it fascinates me to no end.</p>

        <p class="first">An awful lot of what I’ve learnt and what I’m right now has been because of the internships I’d done over the years. Instamojo was my first taste of what a technology company looks like, and how startups work.

        <p>I also worked at Cobalt.io, which is an application security platform for enterprises for a few months, designing and developing their client side dashboard, and working on a lot of product improvements, and random impromptu Design tasks (you
          know how it works at startups!)</p>

          In the summer of 2015, I interned at Wikimedia Foundation (it is the non-profit which owns and operates Wikipedia and other Wikis) at their San Francisco headquarters. </p>
        <p>I worked with their small but amazing Communications team, creating tools which enable them to share the vastness and the immensity of the Wikipedia world through social media. I worked with some of the most passionate Designers, Data Scientists,
          Developers, and Communications people I've known.

          left me with learnings which have helped me immensely since.</p>

        <p>Designing Enterprise software is a different ballgame altogether. The complexities involved, the constrains, the stakeholders, the features, the functionalities, the technicalities, dozens of personas, and hundreds of use-cases – it mind boggling.
          But at the end, it's very rewarding when you think about the thousands of users who are paid to use your product for 8 hours a day, as a part of their job. I’m glad that I’ve gotten the opportunity to do so at Sprinklr.</p>

        <p>Some of the work we’ve done, is truly revolutionary, at the conceptual level in terms of how enterprise UX works. Hit me up if you’d like to know about it (I can’t put it up online yet.)</p>

        <p>Working as an only Designer at a fast growing early stage startup is an incredible experience. There is a lot of freedom to work across different horizontals, be it Design, Development, Product Management, etc.</p>

        <p>Learnt a lot about prioritizing and picking the battles which are important to fight, and then executing in the most efficient manner. I've also learnt more about the business impact of Design, and the various how to build really useful products.</p>
